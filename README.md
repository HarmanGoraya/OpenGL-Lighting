# OpenGL-Lighting

## Program Structure
* To use program put object file in command line
* Only one object file can be input at a time the program does not support multiple polyhedra
* The GUI is mostly self-explanatory pick and choose colors for diffuse, specular, and ambient as well as other components


## What is Implemented
* The Phong Lighting Model is implemented in the vertex shader
* Used the Gouraud shading method to implement the Phong model as the fragment shader does the interpolation
* Half-Toning is implemented, in the second set of shaders
* Painter's Algorithm has been implemented as well
* Three Orthographic projections are visible on the screen when the program is ran
